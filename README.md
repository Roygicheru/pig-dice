# PIG-DICE.
#### A simple game,  Wed 5 Mar 2019
#### By Roy Gicheru.
## Description
This is a simple game where in each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

  * If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
  * If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn     continues.
  * If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the    next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins. A link to my live site is https://roygicheru.github.io/pig-dice/.
